                In design technology I created a solar oven. A solar oven is just basically an oven that uses the power of the sun

​

This is not very effective. However if it's in a situation in which electricity cannot be obtained or very little can, this solar oven is a good item to use. One of the examples is when you are camping.

​

The skills that I need to use is craftmanship skills, which I'm absolutely not good at, research skills, I need to find the tutorial on how to make this and thinking skill.

​

Then there is the 7 habits. I need to have 'put first things first' because need to know which step I should do first. I made a mistake regarding that problem.

​

Overall I had no problem with my solar oven design, but the amount of tape just mustered all over the place makes it very messy and the aluminium foil looks horrendous.

              In science I made a presentation about electric ray fish. I explained how electric ray fishes work, what purposes using electricity can do.



              I chose electric ray fish because I originally thought that choosing electric ray fish would make me different. But in the end, there were 3 people that had the same idea as me.

              For the seven habits i use is sharpen the saw and put first things first
              
              ​
              
              Overall what i think about this work is i think i did a good job on making the design of the ppt.

              In the interlink project of ICT, BI and IPS I made a short story (cerpen) with a world war theme. On this specific story, it is not based on a real world. I made the story myself, just with world war background.

              ​
              
              I also made the story as an e-book profile. 
              
              ​
              
              The skills that I use are thinking skill, because i need to think about the points of the storyline, how the characters go.  Research skills so I can imagine the kind of situation by looking at real-life stories of world war.
              
              ​
              
              The seven habits I used are begin with the end in mind.
              
              ​
              
              I think I did a good job on making the storyline, but the downside is that I don't have a very extensive Indonesian word grammar. Maybe due to my lack of novel reading and talking to my friends in Indonesian.             </p>

              In maths it was a simple project. I was originally asked to make a digital poster about a reference sheet for learning, but I didn't really understand what the instruction was. That isn't really a big deal however, because I think, a simple, note is easier to understand for me.

              ​
              
              The skills that I use are the thinking skills and self management skills

              ​
              
              I managed to do a good job on what I personally think is the most understandable reference sheet for me. I love a simple design, something that goes straight to the point.             </p>

              In music I played a song in C-Major on a guitar. I played twinkle-twinkle star. The song was rather plain, but it's the only song I could think of at that time with C-Major.

              I think I did a good job on playing the music, even if I basically didn't put any effort into it             </p>

              ​In PE I performed a service on badminton. It's not much, but it's honest work.

              There's not much to talk about this "project". I find this very underwhelming because i'm really not exercising at all. I personally think PE is one of the most effected subject on pandemic. I can already imagine how cool it must be to do a 1v1 against your friend in school and make that the project.              </p>

              ​In humanities I made a poster about 'kebijakan publik' and it's basically an institutionalized proposal to solve relevant and real-world problems. I don't think the proposal is supposed to be submitted in a poster on a real life situation, but I think this is the more fun and cool way.

              The topic for this is 'phishing' and it's basically a way of hackers to steal our data and possibly get money from our credit cards. 
              
              ​
              
              I frankly think did a great job on making the poster design, even though I don't really make posters that much I still improve on the littlest of time.             </p>

              ​This is my English project, and what I did was making an explanation text about cars engine.

              ​
              
              All of this are various knowledges I get from the past. I think this is pretty common stuff. Because I just seem to enjoy watching car stuff, I ended up getting the knowledge.

              I think I did a great job, however I was inconsistent on how relevant the topic is. It's hard to find the real topic that I went with; is it about how gasoline engines work? but apart from that I did deliver the information correctly.             </p>
